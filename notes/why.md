# authentic
We want to create a space where people can be themselves without pressure (semi-anonymous profiles).

# organised
We want to fight against the flood of information by allowing people to organise the communities according to its own needs. A community is like a town or a city. It depends on so many factors that you can't find two that are alike. It then makes no sense to have the same tool for all those different entities.

# engaging
We want people to feel engaged in order to help them make this last step that is frightening/boring/ungrateful which is to post valuable information to participate to the common intel. Share value to help others. So many people are looking for answers and so many have them bit so few share them.
